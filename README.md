This repo contains my personal notes on obtaining Italian citizenship

## FAQs
__Q1__: Will I be drafted into the Italian military?  
__A1__: Since 1995, the Italian military has been a strictly volunteer service. Should that change however, you will not be exempt from mandatory service if you otherwise meet the requirements. [source](http://www.youritalianpassport.com/consular-experience.html)  

__Q2__: Will I have to pay taxes to Italy?  
__A2__: If you elect to live in Italy for more than 180 days in a calendar year, you will be subject to Italian taxation. [source](http://www.youritalianpassport.com/consular-experience.html)  

__Q3__: Will acquiring Italian citizenship affect my U.S. or other citizenship(s)?  
__A3__: You will not have to relinquish your U.S. citizenship in having your Italian citizenship recognized, the laws of both countries now allow for dual-citizenship. [source](http://www.youritalianpassport.com/consular-experience.html)  
__A3__: Most Western countries allow their citizens to acquire dual (or multiple) citizenship(s). In some cases, people employed in critical areas of the government (where a person may come across state secrets) are prevented from getting dual citizenship. If you are concerned that obtaining dual citizenship may affect your current citizenship you should contact the local authorities for your country; in any case, according to the principle of jure sanguinis, you have actually been an Italian citizen since birth (if you qualify). Obtaining dual citizenship through ancestry is much different from obtaining it through naturalization, which in many cases can result in the loss of your native citizenship. [source](https://italiancitizenshipassistance.com/faq/#5)  

__Q4__: How much will this cost?  
__A4__: At the very, very least about $1000 per person. I think anyone under 18 will ride for free on their parent's application. The answer will highly depend on how many descendants of our [Key ancestor](/README.md#Key_ancestor) decide to join the party. I'm quite sure there's a ton of stuff I haven't considered yet here, so that's a bare minimum. I'm still working on this. I'm currently in conversation with the folks at italiancitizenshipassistance.com to refine the initial cost estimate they've given me. The major cost will be from hiring a law firm to take the Italian government to court (in Italy) on our behalf. See the [1948](/README.md#1948) section below for why we need to do this. Note that italiancitizenshipassistance.com (the site of the firm I'm looking at hiring to do the legal and paperwork on our behalf) has a "100% MONEY BACK" guarantee. That ends up meaning we'd be refunded about 2/3 of the $1000 if for whatever reason the Italian consulate rejects our application(s).

__Q5__: How long will this take?  
__A5__: Longer than 24 months (potentially much longer). I understand that we could be ready to submit our documentation packages to the Italian Consulates that serve our places of residence 1.5 - 2 years after we "start the process." Then, "the wait lists at many of the consulates exceed 18 months." [source](http://www.youritalianpassport.com/consular-experience.html) See [The process](/README.md#The_process) for more details.  

__Q6__: What are my obligations as an Italian citizen residing abroad?  
__A6__:  Italian citizens who reside outside of Italy for more than 12 months, are required to register with the AIRE registry. AIRE is the acronym for “Anagrafe degli Italiani Residenti all’Estero”, (Registry of Italians Residing Abroad), and it is a registry jointly held by the local Italian Consulate and the municipality of last residency in Italy (for Italian citizens by descent, the municipality of birth of the Italian ancestor). This registration is necessary to be able to access the consular services, including the issuance of an Italian passport and the registration in Italy of vital record documents issued in the foreign country. The registration in the AIRE registry is also necessary to vote in the Italian elections while living abroad. [source](https://italiancitizenshipassistance.com/faq/#5)  

__Q7__: What are the benefits of having Italian/EU citizenship?  
__A7__: Comprehensive, affordable health care, excellent and affordable university-level education (throughout Europe) [source](http://www.youritalianpassport.com/)  
__A7__: Pass Italian citizenship to your descendants [source](http://www.youritalianpassport.com/)  
__A7__: You will be able to transfer Italian citizenship to all children under 18 years old automatically [source](https://italiancitizenshipassistance.com/benefits-of-italian-dual-citizenship/)  
__A7__: Reside, retire, and travel freely within any of the 27 countries of the European Union [source](http://www.youritalianpassport.com/)

__Q7__: Who is eligible to join this Italian citizenship party?  
__A7__: See [Eligibility](/README.md#Eligibility)  

__Q8__: What about the spouses of people who do not meet the requirements in the [Eligibility](/README.md#Eligibility) section?  
__A8__: Foreign women who married Italian men prior to 27 April 1983, automatically acquired Italian citizenship, and therefore are entitled to apply simultaneously for recognition. Additionally, it seems that ALL spouses are also eligible for citizenship after registering the marriage in Italy. [source](https://italiancitizenshipassistance.com/faq/#20) But maybe they must learn Italian? [source](https://italiancitizenshipassistance.com/faq/#63) In any case, the foreign spouse of an EU citizen living in Europe can certainly live indefinately with them and work freely in that country.

__Q9__: Do I have to know/learn the Italian language?  
__A9__: No. Except potentially for the spouses who married in after 27 April 1983 (see above question) who wish to become Italian citizens through marriage (which is a separate application).  

## Eligibility
Who's eligible to join the Italian citizenship party? i.e. who of us is actually an Italian citizen now, but just doesn't have the paperwork (e.g. passport) to prove it?
- all descendants of our [Key ancestor](/README.md#Key_ancestor) __except__ those who descended through Auntie Flo (because this line was broken by Noni's naturalization  to become a US citizen)
- any woman who married a man fitting the above criteria prior to 27 April 1983 [source](https://italiancitizenshipassistance.com/faq/#20)

## The process
Here is an outline of the process to obtain an Italian passport as I understand it now:  [source](https://italiancitizenshipassistance.com/faq)

_Preface_ -- Since our [Key ancestor](/README.md#Key_ancestor) passed on __her__ citizenship before [1948](/README.md#1948), we must win a court case in Italy before it makes any sense to submit our applications for Italian passports/citizenship to the Italian consulates where we live. 
1) Hire an Italian law firm to file a lawsuit through the Civil Court in Rome to challenge the [1948](/README.md#1948) rule -- __0 Days__
1) Law firm does a bunch of stuff for us, including --__1.5-2 years__
    - collection of all required documentation proving our Italian citizenship.
    - translation of said documentation into Italian.
    - authentication of said documentation by Apostilles.
    - taking the Italian govt. to civil court in Rome to argue on our behalf to argue that we're Italian citizens.
    - winning said lawsuit.
1) Law firm delivers each of us a "citizenship packet" -- __0 Days__
1) Each of us goes to our local Italian consulate, pays them 300 EUR and signs up for an appointment to apply for our Italian citizenship to be recognized by Italy. -- __0 Days__
1) Wait for appointment at the Italian consulate -- __3-12 Months__ [source](https://italiancitizenshipassistance.com/faq/#15)
1) Attend appointment with the Italian consulate and deliver them our "citizenship packet" of documentation. -- __0 Days__
1) Wait for the Italian consulate to process our application -- __2-6 Months__ [source](https://italiancitizenshipassistance.com/faq/#15)

## 1948
Watch this two minute youtube video: https://youtu.be/3qUm5CujE2w  

Prior to 1948, under Italian Law only men were able to transfer Italian citizenship to their children, whereas women were discriminated against doing so.  
It was only after the promulgation of the 1948 Italian constitution, which stated that men and women have equal rights, that Italian women were considered by Italian Law to be able to transfer their Italian citizenship onto their children, however, only to those born after January 1st 1948.  
Recently a trial case challenged the above situations as discriminatory and unjust. As a result, those applicants who have a case falling in one of the above categories now have a very good chance of obtaining Italian citizenship due to the precedent established in 2009 in Italian courts and in the many cases that have been won since then.

## Cost
Everything is in Euros here.

€6,500 - hiring the law firm to win the 1948 court case (in Rome) and to provide complete "citizenship packets" for three immediate fmaily members  
€200 for each additional immediate family member's complete "citizenship packets"  
€300 for each additional non-immediate family member's complete "citizenship packets"  
children (under 18) of anyone here seem to be automatically included for free

"immediate fmaily member":  siblings, parents or adult children  
"citizenship packet": all the documentation an Italian consulate needs to issue us a passport  

The above is payable to the Italian/American law firm and will be returned if our applications fail. The Italian consulate takes €300 for each application which is non-refundable and I think children (under 18) are included on their parents applications here so I won't count them as needing to apply.

I count 19 of us who could possibly apply. That's including zero from Uncle Bill's side. If everyone was in, the total cost of the law firm would be €6,500 + 6x€200 + 10x€300 = €10,700. And if we were to split that equally, we'd each owe €563.16. And after the application fee to our Italian consulates, that would come to €863.16 ~= $969.00 each. If 17 of the 19 of us go in, we'd be at $1,010.38 each. If only three of us are in, that would come to $2,769.67 each.

## Key ancestor
Papa's mother, a.k.a Noni, a.k.a Lucy Meli Christoforo  
She is the person from which the claim to Italian citizenship stems. All of her descendants originating from her children from before she Naturalized as a US citizen on 11 September 1928 were theoretically born Italian citizens (okay, this is a dubious statement because of [1948](/README.md#1948)), so have we just have to deliver paperwork proving this to the Italian government so that they'll issue us passports which we can then use to invoke our rights as Italian and EU citizens. Here's some relevant info I've learned about her:
